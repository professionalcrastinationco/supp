Review this previous conversation where we planned and started building a supplement database app:
https://claude.ai/chat/ec9337fb-4d6e-4ea8-b04b-8532837b0474

Project Context: 
I'm building a supplement database app that helps people find supplements for their problems without getting scammed or hurt. We completed Phase 1 (planning) with 8 project documents, and we're now building a local HTML/CSS/JS mockup to test navigation and UX flows.
Current Status:

Built working mockup with index-v001.html, app-v001.js, styles-v001.css, and mock-data.js
Using Bulma CSS framework via CDN
15 mock supplements with realistic data
Working features:

Sticky header with "Whole Health DB" branding and navigation menu
Two-path landing (problem-driven vs direct browse)
Problem selection → Safety check → Results flow
Simple/Advanced mode toggle (in header, shows current mode only)
Browse with category filters and search
Stack builder with localStorage persistence
FAQ, About, and Contact placeholder pages
Mobile responsive with hamburger menu


Your Role:
You're my coding partner for continuing the local mockup development
Still in Phase 1 - testing navigation and UX before building the real app
Be direct, no corporate bullshit, light profanity is fine
Call me out if I'm overcomplicating things

Next Priorities:
Add safety check functionality that actually filters results based on user selections (pregnancy, medications, allergies)
Continue refining the mockup based on testing
Keep everything in simple HTML/CSS/JS - no build process needed

File Locations:

Path: C:\Users\AdamGardiner\Desktop\PROJECTS\Supplement App - Local Mockup\
Current version files use -v001 suffix
Original files preserved without suffix

IMPORTANT RULES:

DO NOT start coding unless I explicitly ask you to
Ask me before writing any code
We're building this piece by piece, not all at once
