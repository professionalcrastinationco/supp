Review this previous conversation where we planned and started building a supplement database app:
https://claude.ai/chat/ec9337fb-4d6e-4ea8-b04b-8532837b0474

Project Context: 
I'm building a supplement database app that helps people find supplements for their problems without getting scammed or hurt. We completed Phase 1 (planning) with 8 project documents, and we're now building a local HTML/CSS/JS mockup to test navigation and UX flows.
Current Status:

Built working mockup with index-v001.html, app-v001.js, styles-v001.css, and mock-data.js
Using Bulma CSS framework via CDN
15 mock supplements with realistic data
Working features:

Sticky header with "Whole Health DB" branding and navigation menu
Two-path landing (problem-driven vs direct browse)
Problem selection → Safety check → Results flow
Simple/Advanced mode toggle (in header, shows current mode only)
Browse with category filters and search
Stack builder with localStorage persistence
FAQ, About, and Contact placeholder pages
Mobile responsive with hamburger menu


Your Role:
You're my coding partner for continuing the local mockup development
Still in Phase 1 - testing navigation and UX before building the real app
Be direct, no corporate bullshit, light profanity is fine
Call me out if I'm overcomplicating things

## Version 002 Update - Safety Features Added

### What's New:
- **Safety check now functional** - Stores user's safety profile (medications, pregnancy, allergies)
- **Contraindication data added** to all 15 supplements:
  - pregnancy_safe: boolean flag
  - medication_interactions: array of medications
  - common_allergies: array of allergens
- **Smart sorting** - Safe supplements show first, contraindicated ones pushed to bottom
- **Visual warnings** - Red backgrounds and warning messages for unsafe supplements
- **Warning messages inline** with each supplement card showing specific contraindication

### How It Works:
- User selections in safety check are stored in `userSafetyProfile` object
- Results are sorted with `sortSupplementsBySafety()` function
- Contraindicated supplements get red background (`has-background-danger-light`)
- Warning notifications show specific safety concerns
- Safety profile resets each session (not persisted)

### Files Updated:
- `mock-data-v002.js` - Added contraindication data to all supplements
- `app-v002.js` - Added safety filtering logic and warning displays
- `index-v002.html` - References v002 files
- `styles-v002.css` - Added red warning styles and animations

Next Priorities:
- Expand to 50+ supplements for better testing of browse/filter
- Add medication/allergy text inputs for specific warnings
- Implement stack-to-stack interaction checking
- Continue refining based on testing

Current version files use -v001 suffix
Original files preserved without suffix

IMPORTANT RULES:

DO NOT start coding unless I explicitly ask you to
Ask me before writing any code
We're building this piece by piece, not all at once
