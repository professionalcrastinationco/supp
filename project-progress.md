# Supplement Database App - Project Progress

## Project Overview
**Goal:** Build a supplement database app that helps people find supplements for their problems without getting scammed or hurt.

**Philosophy:** Evidence-based recommendations, safety-first approach, no bullshit from supplement companies.

---

## Phase 1: Planning & Strategy (COMPLETED âœ…)

### Strategic Documents Created
1. **Features List** - Core navigation, safety features, quality ratings, practical usage
2. **UI/UX Strategy** - Two-path system (Simple/Power modes), mobile-first design
3. **Monetization Strategy** - Freemium model, verified affiliates, no investor money
4. **Technical Architecture** - Next.js, PostgreSQL, Supabase, Vercel hosting
5. **Local Mockup Plan** - HTML/CSS/JS prototype strategy
6. **Legal & Compliance** - FDA disclaimers, liability protection, affiliate disclosure

### Key Strategic Decisions
- **Problem-first discovery** - Users start with symptoms, not supplements
- **Two-mode system** - Simple (3 recommendations) vs Advanced (all data)
- **Safety-first approach** - Contraindication warnings, interaction checking
- **Independent funding** - No supplement company money, transparent affiliates
- **Freemium model** - Basic free, Pro ($7/month), Practitioner ($29/month)

- **Professional styling** - shield icon, gradient headers, animations

#### v006 - Homepage Redesign (CURRENT)
- **Three-column homepage layout** on desktop:
  - Column A: "I Need Help With An Issue"
  - Column B: "I Know What I'm Looking For"

## Current Technical State

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript
- **Styling:** Bulma CSS Framework 1.0.4 + Custom CSS
- **Fonts:** Google Fonts (Inter)
- **Storage:** localStorage for user stack
- **No build process** - Direct file opening in browser

### File Structure
```

â””â”€â”€ documents/          # Planning docs (8 strategy files)
```

### Current Capabilities
âœ… **Complete user flows:**
- Problem selection â†’ Safety check â†’ Personalized results
- Direct browsing with filters and search  
- Stack building with interaction warnings
- Mobile-responsive navigation

âœ… **Safety systems:**
- Contraindication detection and warnings
- Safety-based result sorting
- Visual danger indicators
- Session-based safety profiles

âœ… **Advanced features:**
- Simple/Advanced mode toggle
- localStorage stack persistence
- Category filtering and search
- Evidence-level indicators
- Mobile hamburger menu

### Mock Data
- **15 comprehensive supplements** with:
  - Benefits, warnings, dosing, timing, price
  - Contraindication data (pregnancy, meds, allergies)
  - Evidence levels (gold/silver/bronze)
  - Multiple supplement forms
- **8 health problem categories** with subcategories
- **Realistic interaction data** between supplements and medications

## What's Working Well

### UX Flows
- **Two-path entry** successfully reduces cognitive load
- **Safety check modal** feels professional and trustworthy
- **Visual hierarchy** clearly shows safe vs dangerous supplements
- **Mode toggle** provides appropriate detail levels
- **Stack building** with warnings helps users avoid dangerous combinations

### Technical Implementation
- **No build process** keeps development fast and simple
- **Mobile-first responsive** design works across devices
- **localStorage persistence** maintains user state
- **Event delegation** handles dynamic content efficiently
- **Animation system** provides smooth, professional interactions

### Design Decisions

## Known Issues & Technical Debt

### Current Bugs
- None critical - app functions as intended for mockup testing

### Future Considerations
- Search field could be more intelligent (typo tolerance, suggestions)
- Interaction checking between stack items not yet implemented
- No data persistence beyond localStorage
- Limited to 15 supplements for testing

---

## Next Development Priorities

### Immediate (v007)
1. **Test current three-column layout** - Get user feedback on homepage flow
2. **Expand supplement database** - Add more supplements for better browse testing
3. **Enhanced search functionality** - Better matching, typo tolerance
4. **Stack interaction checking** - Warn about supplement-to-supplement interactions

### Soon After
1. **Natural language improvements** - Better problem â†’ supplement matching  
2. **Progressive disclosure** - More sophisticated Simple/Advanced mode differences
3. **Export functionality** - Stack to PDF for doctor visits
4. **Refined mobile experience** - Test on actual devices

### Before Phase 3 (Real App Development)
1. **Complete user testing** - Get feedback from target users
2. **Navigation flow validation** - Ensure all paths work intuitively
3. **Final mockup polish** - Animations, micro-interactions, error states
4. **Technical specification finalization** - API design, database schema
